The beginning and ending of the secret is unremitting study. Keep always on

all the time: hear all that passes, search out what is going on beneath the
surface, read their characters, discover their tastes and their weaknesses and
keep everything you find out to yourself. Bury yourself in their circles, have
no interests and no ideas except the work in hand, so that your brain is
saturated with one thing only, and you realize your part deeply enough to
avoid the little slips that would counteract the painful work of weeks. Your
success will be proportioned to the amount of mental effort you devote to it.

These three years of work in isolation, when I was thrown onto my own
resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented,
instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my
ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the
fashions which pass as law....By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own
way to the things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of
the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less extended clan of
which I found myself a member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be
taken as an authority....It is in this gesture of "going beyond," to be
something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay
within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one—it is in this
solitary act that one finds true creativity. All others things follow as a
matter of course.

As a man's real power grows

Nobody ever figures out
what life is all about,
and it doesn't matter.
Explore the world.
Nearly everything is interesting
if you go into it deeply enough.
Work as hard and as much as you want to
on the things you like the best.
Don't think about what you want to be,
but what you want to do.
Keep up some kind of minimum with other things
so that society doesn't stop you
from doing anything at all.

There are generally two ways to write bad tests.
One is to miss cases and not be rigorous enough.
This is what happens when developers chase code coverage
without actually thinking about what they're testing...
The other is to test too much and be too specific...
 
The code should not follow the tests,
nor the tests the code.
They should both follow the design.

When you choose technology,
you have to ignore
what other people are doing,

you should expect average performance...
Average performance means
you'll go out of business.
